In this code, all the interpolation will be done using direct interpolation of the distribution function using 
p-point lagrangian interpolation of the inside fine-grid layer values.

The intermediate boundary is also interpolated using 4-point lagrangian interpolation using 1 distribution from coarse node and 3 fine node
